(ii) Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.<br>

4.5.3. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.<br> If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.<br>

Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt out of future sales at any time.<br>
