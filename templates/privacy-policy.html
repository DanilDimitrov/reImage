<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.5.3. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.6. Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</span></p>
