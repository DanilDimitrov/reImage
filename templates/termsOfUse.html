15. Closing Provisions

15.1. Jurisdiction And Venue. These Terms of Use shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Any legal proceedings against Mobile app int, LLC that may arise out of, relate to, or be in any way connected with our Website or these Terms of Use shall be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts of the United States, and you waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.

15.2. Dispute resolution and mandatory Arbitration.

15.2.1. This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt-out procedure described below.
15.2.2. Informal Process First. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Mobile app int, LLC, you will first contact Mobile app int, LLC and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.
15.2.3. Arbitration Agreement. After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, "Claim") relating in any way to your use of Mobile app int, LLC's services and/or products, including the Services, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Mobile app int, LLC or any other user of the Services, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Mobile app int, LLC. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Mobile app int, LLC for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Services that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use these Services by following the procedure described below.


You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision and that you and Mobile app int, LLC are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.

If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to:

Mobile app int, LLC Inc., 1401 Lawrence St, Denver, CO 80202, USA
Email Address: lawyerlukoianov@yahoo.com

We each agree that any claim or dispute between us, and any claim by either of us against any agent, employee, successor, or assign of the other, including, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, third parties who are not signatories to this agreement, whether related to this agreement or otherwise, including past, present, and future claims and disputes, and including any dispute as to the validity or applicability of this arbitration clause, shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the New York International Arbitration Center (or "NYIAC") under its rules and procedures in effect when the claim is filed. The rules and procedures and other information, including information on fees, may be obtained from the NYIAC website (https://nyiac.org/) or by calling NYIAC at +1 917 300 9550.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the "Class Action Waiver" section below.

If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Mobile app int, LLC and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legal@prequalapp.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Services.

15.3. Class action waiver

TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.

Any Claim must be brought in the respective party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiffs, or similar proceeding ("Class Action"). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have the authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.

If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favour of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Mobile app int, LLC each waive any right to a jury trial.

To the extent allowed by law, we each waive any right to trial by jury in any lawsuit, arbitration, or any other proceeding.

If a counter-notice is received by Mobile app int, LLC's Copyright Agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed content or cease disabling it. Unless the original complaining party files an action seeking a court order against the Content Provider, member, or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Mobile app int, LLC's sole discretion.

Please understand that filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party to determine ownership. Be aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in your country if you make a false or bad-faith allegation by using this process.

15.4. Miscellaneous

No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Section headings used in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.

Except where specifically stated otherwise, if any part of these Terms of Use is unlawful or unenforceable for any reason, we both agree that only that part of the Terms of Use shall be stricken and that the remaining terms in the Terms of Use shall not be affected.

These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between us with respect to such subject matter.

You may not assign these Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent. Any such purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent will be null and void and of no force and effect. We may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent and without any notice.
