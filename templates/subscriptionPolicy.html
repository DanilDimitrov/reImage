Introductory Provisions


ReImageApp mobile application provided by Mobile app int, LLC allows you to get certain features and functionality (hereinafter the "Services") by means of a subscription model. For the purpose of this ReImageApp’s Subscription Policy (hereinafter the "Subscription Policy or Policy"), Mobile app int, LLC will be referred to as "Mobile app int, LLC", "we" or "us". For your convenience as the user of the ReImageApp app, you shall be referred to as "you", "your" or "User".

1.1. ReImageApp paid subscription gives you access to the Services for your content editing.

1.2. ReImageApp subscription offers different plans. Depending on the subscription plan chosen, subscriptions are billed monthly or weekly.

1.3. To subscribe for one of the subscription plans, you should use your account in one of the third-party services such as Google Play or App Store.

1.4. Subscription auto-renews at the cost of the chosen subscription plan unless cancelled 24 hours in advance prior to the end of the then-current subscription term. Unless you cancel the subscription before the billing date, you will be automatically charged the subscription fee for the next billing cycle by the third-party service in accordance with the conditions of chosen subscription plan and following the terms and conditions of such third party service.

1.5. From time to time ReImageApp may offer special promotional subscription plans. Special subscription plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you.

1.6. We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, we will provide you with prior notification regarding such changes.

1.7. In the event of a change in price for your subscription plan which you were duly informed of as provided in paragraph 1.6 herein, a new subscription price would be effective from the billing period following the then-current subscription billing period.


2. Cancellation of subscription

2.1. In order to cancel a subscription, please follow the instructions of the respective app store on cancellation of a subscription (for additional instructions on how to cancel a subscription in your third-party service please see terms and conditions of the relevant app store).

2.2. Once your subscription is cancelled, the current subscription plan will be available to you until the end of the billing period, and your subscription will not be renewed after the then-current subscription term expires. The already-started subscription period cannot be discontinued or cancelled.

2.3. No fee paid hereunder shall be refundable, notwithstanding suspension or termination of your account at ReImageApp, your failure to utilize any part of the services (including features and/or functionality available under paid subscription and/or on a paid basis), the prepayment or cancellation of the services or for any reason whatsoever, except where otherwise specified by Mobile app int, LLC.

2.4. When you purchase a subscription, you undertake an in-app purchase, and the payment for such purchase will be processed directly by the owner of the app store, and will be governed by their terms and conditions as well as other applicable policies. Please review and accept the terms and conditions of the app store with regard to your rights to cancel orders and get related refunds. Thus, if you have any payment-related issues you are advised to contact the app store directly. All purchases made through services are final and non-refundable, except when required by law. You agree you will not receive money or other compensation for unused services.


3. Closing provisions


3.1. Any reference in paragraph 1.4 herein to a specific time shall refer to the time in the time zone where you were located at the moment of commencement of the related event (for example, a reference to the cancellation of a subscription 24 hours in advance prior to the end of the then-current subscription term means that 24 hours should be counted in the same time zone where you initially subscribed for your current subscription plan).

3.2. By subscribing you acknowledge that subscription is available in more than one country and that the currencies used by those countries may vary, and may fluctuate in value during the term of your subscription. Please acknowledge that as Mobile app int, LLC is not processing payment for the subscription, we rescind any responsibility for the changes in subscription price resulting from the reflection by the app store of any fluctuations in the exchange rate.

3.3. Please acknowledge that as Mobile app int, LLC is not processing payment for the subscription, we rescind from responsibility for

(i) any fees or commissions relating to the processing of payment of subscription price,

(ii) any refusal of the payment method (including payment methods as provided in paragraph 1.3 herein or any bank or credit organization you used to process the payment) to accept and/or process.

Any complaints regarding payment processing should be filed to the respective app store, bank or financial institution through which the respective payment was made.
